Every tasty fruit basket needs oranges, so you decide to add six oranges. 
As a data analyst, your reflex is to immediately create the variable my_oranges and assign 
the value 6 to it. Next, you want to calculate how many pieces of fruit you have in total. 
Since you have given meaningful names to these values, you can now code this in a clear way: 

my_apples + my_oranges


    Assign to my_oranges the value 6.
    Add the variables my_apples and my_oranges and have R simply print the result.
    Assign the result of adding my_apples and my_oranges to a new variable my_fruit.

# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5


# Add these two variables together
my_oranges <- 6

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges

my_fruit
